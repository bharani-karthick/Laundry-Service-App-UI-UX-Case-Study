- This repository documents a UI/UX case study for a mobile laundry service application.

- The project focuses on simplifying laundry booking, order tracking, and service management.

- The goal was to replace traditional offline workflows with a clear, efficient, and user-centric digital experience.

- The complete case study was designed using Figma.

# Problem Statement

- Many laundry services rely on manual and offline processes.

- Users are required to place orders through phone calls or in-store visits.

- There is a lack of transparency in order status and service communication.

- These issues lead to user frustration and reduced trust.

# Design Goals

- Simplify the end-to-end laundry booking process.

- Provide clear and real-time order visibility.

- Reduce user effort and cognitive load.

- Deliver a clean, intuitive, and accessible mobile interface.

# Target Users

# Key User Pain Points

- No real-time order tracking.

- Inconvenient scheduling experience.

- Unclear pricing and service details.

- Dependence on manual follow-ups.

# Design Process

- Research and analysis of existing laundry service workflows.

- Identification of common usability and communication gaps.

- Definition of core user problems and needs.

- Creation of user flows and information structure.

- Development of wireframes and high-fidelity UI designs.

- Iteration to improve clarity, usability, and consistency.

# Information Architecture

- User flows were created to map key user journeys within the application.

- The focus was on task completion and usability.

- A detailed sitemap was explored during early planning.

- For clarity and readability, this case study highlights user flows instead of the complete sitemap.

# User Flow
